//1:what is javaScript

// 1.1:Introduction to javascript

// Javascript is a high level language or dynamic and interpreted programing language primarily used for Creating interactive web pages and web applications . 

// it was initiall developed by brendan H in 1895 at nNetscape Communication Cooperation and now is part of Mozilla 

// Despite its name JavaScript is not related to java Programming language and has a different syntax and semantics

// JavaScript is a client site programming language which means that the code is executed in the user's web browser ,however, with the introduction of node.js

// JavaScript can also be used in server side scripting allowing developers to build more web applications using a single language.

// 1.2: How JavaScript Works

// JavaScript is interprated language which means that the code is executed directly by a ajavaScript engine without being compiled into machine code beforehand.

// Web browsers include built in JavaScript engines such as google's v8 used in chrome ans node.js and mozilla spider used in mozilla firefox

// when a web page is loaded a JavaScript engine creares an execution context for the script, which include the global execution context and function ecxecution contexts. the engine then follows  the stack to execute line by line. JavaScript uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations such as timers,networks and user interactions.

// 1.3:Adding JavaScript to a web page

// There are three main ways to include javascript in an HTML dOCUMENT

// a. Inline scripts: JvaScript can be directly placed or embedded within the script tags in the HTML files

// b.External Scripts:This is where JavaScript code can be placed in a separate .js file and included in the Html file using<script> tag with src attribute pointing to the external file

// c.Event Handlers: Javascript can be attached to HTML element through event handlers such as onclick,onmouseover,etc.

// 1.4:JavaScript in modern web development

// jAVAscript plays a crucial role in modern web development enabling the creation of dyynamic websites and applications

// With the rise of single Page Apllicatipns(SPAs) and the increasing complexion of web applications JavaScript has become an essential tool for building rich user interfaces and handling client logic.

// JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React Angular and Vue.js, have gained immense popularity, provide developers with tools and conventions to buoild scalable and maintenable applications

// Additionally , JavaSxript is increasingly being used in areas beyond web devolopment such as mobile app development through technologies like react native,Desktop applications with Electron and even Internet Of Things

// 1.5:jAVAsCRIPT VERSIONS AND STANDARDS

// jAVAsCRIPT IS STANDARDIZED UNDER the ECMAscript (ES) language specific,mainrtained by ECMA Intyerantional Organization. The latest version of ECMAScript is ES20222(ECMAScript), released in june 20222.

// As new versions of ECMAScript are released they introduce new syntax and features to the language., However, to ensure compatibility across different browsers  and environments, modern JavaScript code often needs to be transpiled(converted) into a more widely support using tools like Babel.

// ECMAScript standard is devloped and maintained by TC39 COMMMITTEW, which consist representatives from various companies and orfanizations involved in web development.

// TC39 is responsible for proposing,reviewing and approving new language features and improvements.
